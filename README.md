# Automatic unflooding for subsalt waveform inversion
This is an implantation of the salt unflooding in the paper [**Deep learning unflooding for robust subsalt waveform inversion
**] (https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.02947)

## I am still editing the code and running some tests so things might be messy a bit.
